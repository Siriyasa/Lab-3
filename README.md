1.Approach to Dimensionality Reduction and Clustering
The study used Principal Component Analysis (PCA) to decrease dimensionality, KMeans clustering to identify distinct clusters, Hierarchical clustering to explore alternative clustering structures within the data, and simulated student engagement and performance data for a total of 100 students.

2.Results of the Analysis
Using KMeans and hierarchical clustering, the study noticed three clusters: moderate, high, and low. While students in Cluster 3 could need substantial support, students in Cluster 2 might benefit from focused therapy. However, Cluster 1 students can benefit from focused therapy becauseÂ they are academically successful and highly motivated.


3.Implications for Learning Analytics
Personalized assistance strategies can be developed using learning analytics for students specific clusters, such as Cluster 3. Additionally, predictive models can be used to think learning outcomes and address possible problems. To maximize the impact on student success, assets like technology support, guidance, and tutoring can be provided based on these clusters.
